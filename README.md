# Group-ICA-dHCP
The goal is to perform grouped Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to extract meaningful signals from neonatal brains via the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP). These Independent Components are planned to be used as an input for SwiFUN, to extract task-related information from resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Images (rsfMRI).
