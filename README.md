# Grouped Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP)
The goal is to perform grouped Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to extract meaningful signals from neonatal brains via the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP). These Independent Components are planned to be used as an input for SwiFUN, to extract task-related information from resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Images (rsfMRI).

## Data

A total of 100 healthy subjects have been chosen. In this sense, we choose normally developing children, i.e. the ones with low risk of developmental delay according to their BSID-III and Q-CHAT scores. There are 725 subjects who have undertaken both Q-CHAT and BSID-III tests. In order to be seen with low risk of developmental delay, children need a BSID-III score higher than 85 regarding the cognitive, language and motor composite scores and a Q-CHAT score lower than or equal to 32.

408 from 725 children pass all tests. This means that 317 do not pass the test and are at risk of developmental delay/autism.

From these subjects, we have chosen 100 random children to use for group ICA. The ids of these subjects may be found in the file **healthy_subjects_ids.txt**. Some of these subjects have undergone multiple fMRI sessions - we have chosen to only use one fMRI session per subject for analysis.

For people with access to the ConnectomeLAB internal server, these files may be downloaded via the **download_healthy_subjects.py** script. Please make sure that everything is set up correctly in the ssh config file.

### Justification for Q-CHAT Threshold

Although [one study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18240013/) suggests that
typically developing children receive a score between 19 and 35 while
children who later develop ASD receive a score between 38 and 66, all major
literature derives a binary classification problem from this, such that:

* **lower or equal to 32:** low risk of being intellectually challenged
* **higher than 32:** high risk of being intellectually challenged

This is confirmed by the study [The Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ): Evidence from Asperger Syndrome/High-Functioning Autism, Males and Females, Scientists and Mathematicians](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1005653411471).

Other literature citing above article to support their decision of following
a binary classification problem:

### Justification for BSID-III Threshold

The [official paper](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Bayley_Scales_of_Infant_and_Toddler_Development)
of BSID-III states the assumption of a normal distribution,
with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. In fact, the official source
interprets it in 3 different classes, which are composed of:

* **greater than or equal to 85:** average
* **lower than 85:** risk of developmental delay
* **lower than 75:** moderate to severe mental impairment

In this assumption, almost all major publications trying to derive a machine
learning problem in this sense define it as a binary classification problem:

* **greater than or equal to 85:** low risk of developmental delay
* **lower than 85:** high risk of developmental delay

We can see that our data largely represents and supports these assumptions.

* [Early prediction of cognitive deficits in very preterm infants using functional connectome data in an artificial neural network framework](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158218300329)

## Setup

The setup works successfully for **Python 3.9.19**. **It did not work for newer Python versions!!!**

For this workflow, we use tools from **FSL 6.0.7.12**, namely *fslmerge* and *MELODIC*. You can download FSL [here](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation). On Linux, make sure to add following files in your *bashrc* to set the necessary environment.

```
export FSLDIR="/home/<user>/fsl"
source $FSLDIR/etc/fslconf/fsl.sh
export PATH=$FSLDIR/bin:$PATH
```

## Workflow

1. concatenate fMRI images along the temporal axis - **concat_fmri.sh**
2. generate group ICA map - **run_group_ica.sh**
3. mask group ICA map - **extract_features.py**
4. dual regression + connectivity map extraction - **extract_features.py**

Current issues I face include:

* when concatenating fMRI images, we see that we have inconsistent orientations for individual images
    * the info on orientation is not included in the images -> assumption that the orientation is the same in all images, which makes the assumption of voxel-based orientation correct
    * on further consideration, this assumption is incorrect. fsleyes gives an error message -> we need to correct the affine matrix
* it is still unclear which exact mask to use on the group ICA map, since there are 9 different masks for different gestational ages
    * OR-concatenate all masks and use the overlap (?)
